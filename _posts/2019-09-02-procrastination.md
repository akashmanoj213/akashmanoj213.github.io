It took me a long time to create this site. Actually, I had created the site a long time ago but to actually write my first blog took a whole lot of time. Thinking back, I can see that there was no lack of enthusiasm. I used to be really excited to have something of my own published onto the internet. The problem, was that as soon as I did something small, I used to feel so inebriated... which is nuts ! I would sit down thinking I would get the blog published today but what would happen is, I would sit and write a paragraph and I would feel so satisfied with it that I would feel its enough for a day.
