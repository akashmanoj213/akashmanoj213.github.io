Water fasting is a form of fasting that restricts eating or drinking everything except water.

I am starting on a 5 day fast and I will be updating what I go through on a daily basis here.

## Day 1
I started off today by having little avocado shake that I had left over from yesterday and didn't want to throw out. Completed my work out and cleaned up my room just like usual and did not feel anything different. The fasting freed up a lot of time in my schedule as I don't have to cook my breakfast or dinner, so I was watching an episode of Lost (yes, the old Lost) to pass time till my friend picked me up for work.

At office I was fine till 10 am as I usually go that long without having anything. But after 10, I started feeling a bit hungry. I felt that today was a bad day to start the fast as a colleague of mine had brought carrot halwa and another guy had brought my favorite sweet for distributing as it was his birthday. But I just consoled myself thinking, denying food on the face of temptation would really help me with my willpower.

At 12 pm, I started feeling hungry and more than that, I realized that I don't have anything to look forward too. These lunch and snack breaks that I have act as sort of milestones throughout my day in the sense that it gives me a break to look forward too. I usually go for lunch at around 12.45 and this is the first natural time-out that I get from my work. Now since I was not going for lunch, there was no such time-out that I could take.
I made up for my feelings of hunger with just having water and I must have had a lot of water today as I had to pee a lot more than usual throughout my day.

At 3 pm, I started feeling a lack of focus and the onset of what seemed to me like a fever. I worked through it and left for home at 5.30 pm. As soon as I reached home, I had another wave of disappointment hit me as I realized I couldn't do my usual snacking. This again ties into the feeling that there is no "break" that I can look forward too. I watched the second season's finale of DARK and did the dishes from the previous night. After it was over, I decided to take a nap as I was feeling really tired. But my nap went on till 9.30 pm and I missed a daily meeting that we have with our client. I felt that I am more tired than usual. At 10 pm, I started updating this blog and am hoping to sleep by 11.30 pm.

## Day 3
I woke up at 6.30 today. My regular sleep schedule is totally disrupted at this point. I went to the washroom which was surprising to me as I haven't eaten anything in the past 2 days. Later proceeded to do my workout but could muster the effort to complete only 1/4 th of what I noramlly would do. But something is better than nothing right? I didn't want to stop working out completely as I didn't want to lose my muscle mass during these days of fasting. Later I got ready and went to office like usual. As usual there was some sweet on offer today too, this time it was a chocolate. I quickly ignored that and continued with my work. Most of today went by without any significant events. I wasn't feeling very weak, but the occasional tiredness was still there. Came home and slept for 2 hours straight and then got up and worked till 12. I did not watch any TV today, instead I just used that time for sleeping. I felt today was the most productive day since I started the fast.

## Day 4
Today was the day of breaking my fast. I got up pretty late at around 7 am. But I was feeling well rested. Skipped my workout and room cleaning as I was late for work and got ready and left. Today was a busy day at work as we had to meet a deadline and it took a lot of energy to get everything done. I found myself feeling dull during most of the first half. I just wanted to go home soon. But in retrospect, I feel that the knowledge that I would be breaking my fast and would be eating something after 4 days of fasting made me more agitated. I again had something to look forward too and I just wanted to get home.

The second half of the day was pretty eventful cause something unexpected came up and we had to fix it quickly to get the release done on time. All the activity (and the fact that only few more hours were left before I could taste something again) kind of got me pumped and excited again. I finished all my work on time and reached home at around 6 pm. I started watching TV to pass time till my food arrived and it came around 7 pm. I had ordered lots of yogurt and yakult to break my fast as I wanted a healthy culture of gut bacteria to be present. Later I made some chapatti and chilly paneer. I could instantly feel the change in energy from eating and its 12.30 am here and I still have not slept.
