Hello there !

My name is Akash and I live in Bangalore. My parents live in Ernakulam which is an awesome state in Kerala and that's where I spent the first 17 years of my life too. I love Computers, programming and playing games on them, and I also love reading about psychology because its serves as a user manual of sorts to the way I function. I don't have very many hobbies, of course I often binge watch a lot of shows on Netflix or Prime but I wouldn't consider that as a hobby :D.

I work as a Software Engineer for the most part of my week and put my thinking cap on for the rest of the time so as to try and find out a hobby for myself. This was one of the main reasons why I decided to start this blog. I wanted to explore what I was good at and what I wasn't cut out for and share them here so that someone else might benefit or get inspired from them too.

To sum up my personality into an "About" section is really difficult but you would find a lot of my personality scattered through out this website. So if you want to know more about me then start reading all my [blogs]({{ "/blogs/" | relative_url }}) one by one ;)
